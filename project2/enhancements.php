Provide the manager with the ability to select the field on which to sort the order in which the EOI records are displayed.

Create a manager registration page with server side validation requiring unique username and a password rule, and store this information in a table.

Control access to manage.php by checking username and password.

Have access to the web site disabled for user a period of time on, say, three or more invalid login attempts.


All of these have been done. The final enhancement applies to just "applicant" users, on the "User Account" page.
